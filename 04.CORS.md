# Adding CORS support to your REST API

While accessing the REST API, you might face issues concerning Same Origin Policy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy].

Errors like :

"No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. Origin ‘http://127.0.0.1:8080′ is therefore not allowed access." OR

"XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://abc.com/bla. Origin http://localhost:12345 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." are common in such case.

Solution is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/]. Basically, on server side, we can return additional CORS access control headers with response, which will eventually allow further inter-domain communication.

With Spring, we can write a simple filter which adds those CORS specific headers in each response.

```java
@Component
public class CorsFilter implements Filter {
 
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) res;
        response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE");
        response.setHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "3600");
        response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "x-requested-with, Custom-Header-1 , Custom-Header-2, X-Auth-Token");
        chain.doFilter(req, res);
    }
 
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) {}
 
    public void destroy() {}
 
}
```

Make sure to include the Filter package into Spring Boot application component scan.
