# Writing REST Client using RestTemplate

If you want to consume REST based web services from your application, you would need a REST client for your application. One of the most popular HTTP client is Apache HttpComponents HttpClient. But the details to access REST services using this are too low level.

Spring’s RestTemplate comes to rescue. RestTemplate provides higher level methods that correspond to each of the six main HTTP methods that make invoking many RESTful services a one-liner and enforce REST best practices.

Spring Boot provides RestTemplateBuilder that can be used to customize the RestTemplate before calling the REST endpoints. If you are not customizing the REST template \[No additional header e.g.\], we may prefer to directly use RestTemplate.

The following are HTTP methods and corresponding RestTemplate methods to handle that type of HTTP request.

* HTTP GET : getForObject, getForEntity
* HTTP PUT : put(String url, Object request, String…​urlVariables)
* HTTP DELETE : delete
* HTTP POST : postForLocation(String url, Object request, String…​ urlVariables), postForObject(String url, Object request, Class responseType, String…​ uriVariables)
* HTTP HEAD : headForHeaders(String url, String…​ urlVariables)
* HTTP OPTIONS : optionsForAllow(String url, String…​ urlVariables)
* HTTP PATCH and others : exchange execute
